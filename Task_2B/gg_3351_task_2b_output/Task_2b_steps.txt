Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. We looked at the images in the training dataset provided to identify a suitable input size for our CNN.

2. We experimented with various pre-trained models (modifying them to our needs) and batch sizes, training each one for 10 epochs.

3. We found a batch size of 32 and efficientNet_v2 small model to yield the best results.

4. We experimented with input image size to balance between data retention and training speed. We found a size of (275,183) to be ideal.

5. We trained the model for 100 epochs to achieve an accuracy of 98.80% on train set and 100% on test set.

6. We tested the model on data aquired from google images to test its effectiveness.
